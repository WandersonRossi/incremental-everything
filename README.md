A RemNote plugin which allows you to interleave flashcard reviews with other information like notes, books, websites, videos and more!

### Features

- **Incremental Writing**: Write your essays and blog posts incrementally over time.
- Plugin support! Any plugin widget can easily integrate with Incremental Everything. See the guitar and mathematics examples.

### Installation

- Open the [RemNote plugin store](https://www.remnote.com/plugins), search for "Incremental Everything" and install the plugin. It works on all devices.

### Usage

- Tag a Rem with the `Incremental` tag using the `/Incremental Everything` command to turn it into an incremental Rem.
- Change an incremental Rem's priority using the `/Prioritize` command.
- The plugin will automatically add incremental Rem to your queue and show them to you when you review flashcards.
- Inside the queue, you can control how many incremental Rem you want to see and how they are sorted using the Sorting Criteria menu button.

### Scheduling

### Development Details

- The plugin stores repetition data as hidden slots on the Rem. So these aren't "normal" RemNote flashcards. All of the scheduling is managed by the plugin.
